## Architecture
- Services we used
    - 1 * Azure function app (3 * Azure Functions)
    - 3 * Graph APIs
        - [Subscription - change notifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/webhooks?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true)
        - [Get event](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/event-get?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)
        - [Get callRecord](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/callrecords-callrecord-get?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)
        - [Get chatMessage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/chat-list-messages?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http#request-2)
    - 1 * Blob storage (auto-created by the program)
    - ADX
- Work Flow
    - ![](./img/new_architecture.png)
    - The `RenewSubscription` azure function is our entry point
    - It will subscribe for the resources that we needed, such as callRecord and user event. Then the information that we need will be sent to the endpoint azure functions.
    - Then the endpoint azure function will get the target resource using specific API and store them to our storage account.

## General Information
### Advantage
- This is a project about **Security**.
- If confidential disclosure happened, we can **utilize these logs** to find out who are the **suspicious insiders**.
### Problem Definition and Scenario
- Problem: Whether the insider exist in teams?
- Definition of an **insider**:
    - They may hold or join some abnormal meetings.
- Definition of an **abnormal meetings**:
    - 1 **on 1** meeting. (especially a meeting who’s email address ends with @gmail, @hotmail, etc. 
    - Screen sharing in meeting would be suspicious.

<!-- ### Why 30 minutes waiting is needed?
- Logs about the call will be recorded in the blob storage 30 minutes later after the meeting ends.
    - For example. If the meeting ends at 11:10. Logs about the call will be sent to blob storage at 11:40. -->

## Steps To Demo
### Prerequisite
1. Having a teams admin account.
    - You can create a demo account here. (https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/my-tenants)
        ![](./img/Prerequisite/DemoMicrosoft.png)

#### Variables Needed Modified
#### Blob storage related
- "BlobConnectionString",
<!-- - "BlobContainerName_CallRecords",
- "BlobContainerName_UserEvents",
- "BlobContainerName_SubscriptionList": "subscription-container",
- "BlobFileName": "subscriptionList.json", -->
##### Explanation
- `BlobConnectionString` is the blob connectionstring, where you want to store your data. In this case, it is the connection string of `abnormalmeetingstorage`
<!-- - `BlobContainerName_CallRecords`, `BlobContainerName_UserEvents` are the containers that are used to store results after calling graph api
- `BlobContainerName_SubscriptionList` is the container that used to store the `BlobFileName`, which will be used in subscription. -->
#### Azure Active Directory
<!-- - "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{0}",
- "ApiUrl": "https://graph.microsoft.com/", -->
- "Tenant",
- "ClientId",
- "ClientSecret",
##### How to get `Tenant`, `ClientId`, `ClientSecret`
- You have already get the `ClientSecret` [here](#prerequisite)
- Go to "Azure Active Dirrectory" -> "App Registrations" -> "Overview" and record several infornmation
    - `Tenant`: Specified in "Directory (tenant) ID"
    - `ClientId`: Specified in "Application (client) ID"
#### Function URLs (for webhook)
- "FunctionAppName"
    - The name of your azure function app (endpoint)
- "FunctionDefaultKey"
    - The master key of azure function app
<!-- - "Webhook_CallRecords",
- "Webhook_UserEvents"
##### How to get `Webhook_CallRecords`, `Webhook_UserEvents`
- After you deployed the function app to Azure, go to "AbnormalMeetings" -> "Funtions" -> "GetCallRecords" or "GetUserEvents" -> "get function url" to get the webhook urls
  ![azPortal_getWebhook](./img/azPortal_getWebhook.png) -->

<!-- ## Usage
- After deployment and setting configuration, the function will start working!
- You can go to "Monitor" in functions to monitor the logs of azure functions -->

## Features 
> Here we describe what each .cs file does.
### RenewSubscription.cs
- All subscription-related tasks will be done here.
- The program will read the json file specifiled in `BlobFileName`, under the container specified in `BlobContainerName_SubscriptionList`. 
- The json file's format is, for example, 
    ```json
    {
        "value":[
            {
                "UserId":"7f5b5e74-ba40-4aed-95be-d55a57e684fa",
                "SubscriptionId":"b32157a5-3dfc-4743-b84b-5dcb6c90c0ed"
            },
            ...,
            {
                "UserId":"callRecordId","SubscriptionId":"b6978c22-d086-47de-8f0b-31e68a5302f8"
            }
        ]
    }        
    ```
#### Renew CallRecords Subscription
- If the CallRecords have been subscribed before and have been recorded in `BlobFileName` ("UserId":"callRecordId"), just simply renew the subscription; otherwise, create a subscription and record it into `BlobFileName`.
#### Renew UserEvent Subscriptions
- I will get all users under the target tenant, if the user have been subscribed before and have been recorded in `BlobFileName` ("UserId":"{TheUserId}}"), just simply renew the subscription; otherwise, create a subscription and record it into `BlobFileName`.
### GetCallRecords.cs
- When the program recieves http request from the subscription resource, the program will be triggered.
- Use the call Id to get the callrecord and save it as a json file to container specified in `BlobContainerName_CallRecords`, using graph api SDK
    ```C#
    CallRecord callrecord = await graphServiceClient.
    // Here we used "Expand" to get full infornmation
    // in callrecord
    Communications.CallRecords[call_Id]
                    .Request()
                    .Expand("sessions($expand=segments)")
                    .GetAsync();
    ```
- If the environment variable `IsChatApi` is `true`, we are going to get the chatMessage from chatMessage API
    ```C#
    // Get the chat id from regex
    string chatid = matches[0].Value; 
    string resource = $"chats/{chatid}/messages";
    string webApiUrl = $"{config.ApiUrl}v1.0/{resource}"; // combine the resource to endpoint api
    HttpResponseMessage response = await httpClient.GetAsync(webApiUrl);
    ```
### GetUserEvents.cs
- When the program recieve http request from the subscription resource, the program will be triggered.
- Use the `resource` to get the event object and save it as a json file to container specified in `BlobContainerName_UserEvents`, using Http request.
    ```C#
    // The resource are the target
    // of user event subscription resource
    string resource = subscriptionData.value[0].resource;
    string webApiUrl = $"{config.ApiUrl}v1.0/{resource}";
    HttpResponseMessage response = await httpClient.GetAsync(webApiUrl);
    ```
