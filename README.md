## Steps To Demo
### Prerequisite
1. Having an ***admin account*** of an organization or having a ***client secret*** with [required API permissions](#required-api-permissions)
2. [Create a blob storage with several containers](#create-bolb-storage-and-containers)
### Deploy
- Step 1: Clone this project.
- Step 2: Create a [Function App named "AbnormalMeetings"](#create-function-app)
- Step 3: [Deploy source code to Azure.](#deploy-source-code)
- Step 4: [Setup environment variables.](#setting-environment-variables-configuration)
### Demo
#### CallRecords
- Step 1: [Join/Create] a [call/meeting] in teams.
- Step 2: Wait others to join.
- Step 3: [Share/not share] your screen.
- Step 4: After all tests, end the [call/meeting].
- Step 5: **Wait 30 minutes.** 
- Step 6: Go to your `blob storage` to check your log!
#### UserEvents
- Step 1: [Create/Modify] a event in [outlook/teams].
- Step 2: **Wait 30 minutes.**
- Step 3: Go to your `blob storage` to check your log!

## General Information
### Requirement and Scenario
- TSMC want to know whether the insiders exist in Teams.
- The abnormal meeting has two characteristics.
    1. 1 on 1 meeting, especially meeting with the one using personal email.
    2. Screen sharing in the meeting.
- This project is tended to find out 
    1. How many people are there in the call?
    2. Is screen sharing in the meeting?
    3. Email addresses of the call participates.
- Finally, we write the information to Azure storage container.
<!-- ### Why 30 minutes waiting is needed?
- Logs about the call will be recorded in the blob storage 30 minutes later after the meeting ends.
    - For example. If the meeting ends at 11:10. Logs about the call will be sent to blob storage at 11:40. -->

<!-- ### Environment variables
- All variables which has been `highlighted`, are variables in environment. -->

<!-- ## Screenshots
- Successfully Run in VS
    ![successRunInVS_20220919](./img/successRunInVS_20220919.png) -->
<!-- If you have screenshots you'd like to share, include them here. -->

## Setup
### Required API permissions
> Please make sure that you have all API permissions below.
- User.Read.All
    - For "List Users"
- Calendars.Read
    - For "List Events"
- CallRecords.Read.All
    - For "CallRecords"
#### How to add permissions?
![](./img/azPortal_ApiPermissions.png)

### Create Bolb storage and containers
- we create a blob storage named `callrecordsaved`
- then create three containers
    - callrecord-save
    - subscription-list
    - userevents
- add a blank json file named `subscriptionList.json` in container `subscription-list`
    ![](./img/azPortal_containers.png)

### Create Function App
- Go to Azure Portal
    - Go to "Function App" -> Create a function app named "AbnormalMeetings" 
        ![](./img/azPortal_createApp.png)
### Deploy Source Code
- Open project in `src` folder using Visual Studio 2022
- Right click "Publish..." in Visual Studio 2022
    ![vsPublish_withSteps](./img/vsPublish_withSteps.png)
- Choose to publish in "Azure" -> "Azure Function App (Windows) -> "AbnormalMeetings"
- Click "finish" botton
    ![vsPublish_profile](./img/vsPublish_profile.png)
- Then click "publish" button.
    ![](./img/vsPublish_profilePublish.png)
- **Well done!** The function app has been deployed in Azure.
### Setting Environment Variables (Configuration)
<!--
- The specified location will be 
    1. Deployed Azure: in the environment variable
    2. Local develop (Visual Studio): local.setting.json
-->
- Belows are all needed configuration variables.
- If you are deploying them on Azure, please go to "Function App" -> "AbnormalMeetings" -> "Configuration" (in settings) and add/modify the configuration.
    ![azPortal_functionApp_configuration](./img/azPortal_functionApp_configuration.png)
- If you are developing them locally, please go to "local.settings.json" and add/modify the configuration.

#### Variables Needed Modified
#### Blob storage related
- "BlobConnectionString",
<!-- - "BlobContainerName_CallRecords",
- "BlobContainerName_UserEvents",
- "BlobContainerName_SubscriptionList": "subscription-list",
- "BlobFileName": "subscriptionList.json", -->
##### Explanation
- `BlobConnectionString` is the blob connectionstring, where you want to store your data. In this case, it is the connection string of `callrecordsaved`
<!-- - `BlobContainerName_CallRecords`, `BlobContainerName_UserEvents` are the containers that are used to store results after calling graph api
- `BlobContainerName_SubscriptionList` is the container that used to store the `BlobFileName`, which will be used in subscription. -->
#### Azure Active Directory
<!-- - "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{0}",
- "ApiUrl": "https://graph.microsoft.com/", -->
- "Tenant",
- "ClientId",
- "ClientSecret",
##### How to get `Tenant`, `ClientId`, `ClientSecret`
- You have already get the `ClientSecret` [here](#required-api-permissions)
- Go to "Azure Active Dirrectory" -> "App Registrations" -> "Overview" and record several infornmation
    - `Tenant`: Specified in "Directory (tenant) ID"
    - `ClientId`: Specified in "Application (client) ID"
#### Function URLs (for webhook)
- "Webhook_CallRecords",
- "Webhook_UserEvents"
##### How to get `Webhook_CallRecords`, `Webhook_UserEvents`
-After you deployed the function app to Azure, go to "AbnormalMeetings" -> "Funtions" -> "GetCallRecords" or "GetUserEvents" -> "get function url" to get the webhook urls
  ![azPortal_getWebhook](./img/azPortal_getWebhook.png)

<!-- ## Usage
- After deployment and setting configuration, the function will start working!
- You can go to "Monitor" in functions to monitor the logs of azure functions -->

## Features 
> Here we describe what each .cs file does.
### RenewSubscription.cs
- All subscription-related tasks will be done here.
- The program will read the json file specifiled in `BlobFileName`, under the container specified in `BlobContainerName_SubscriptionList`. 
- The json file's format is, for example, 
    ```json
    {
        "value":[
            {
                "UserId":"7f5b5e74-ba40-4aed-95be-d55a57e684fa",
                "SubscriptionId":"b32157a5-3dfc-4743-b84b-5dcb6c90c0ed"
            },
            ...,
            {
                "UserId":"callRecordId","SubscriptionId":"b6978c22-d086-47de-8f0b-31e68a5302f8"
            }
        ]
    }        
    ```
#### Renew CallRecords Subscription
- If the CallRecords have been subscribed before and have been recorded in `BlobFileName` ("UserId":"callRecordId"), just simply renew the subscription; otherwise, create a subscription and record it into `BlobFileName`.
#### Renew UserEvent Subscriptions
- I will get all users under the target tenant, if the user have been subscribed before and have been recorded in `BlobFileName` ("UserId":"{TheUserId}}"), just simply renew the subscription; otherwise, create a subscription and record it into `BlobFileName`.
### GetCallRecords.cs
- When the program recieves http request from the subscription resource, the program will be triggered.
- Use the call Id to get the callrecord and save it as a json file to container specified in `BlobContainerName_CallRecords`, using graph api SDK
    ```C#
    CallRecord callrecord = await graphServiceClient.
    // Here we used "Expand" to get full infornmation
    // in callrecord
    Communications.CallRecords[call_Id]
                    .Request()
                    .Expand("sessions($expand=segments)")
                    .GetAsync();
    ```
### GetUserEvents.cs
- When the program recieve http request from the subscription resource, the program will be triggered.
- Use the `resource` to get the event object and save it as a json file to container specified in `BlobContainerName_UserEvents`, using Http request.
    ```C#
    // The resource are the target
    // of user event subscription resource
    string resource = subscriptionData.value[0].resource;
    string webApiUrl = $"{config.ApiUrl}v1.0/{resource}";
    HttpResponseMessage response = await httpClient.GetAsync(webApiUrl);
    ```
